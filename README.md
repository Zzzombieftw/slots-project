## PseudoCode for slot machine
 * Define const for the money, for each element in the slots, etc.
* Cache all the html elements so i will be able to render all the random numbers   
    for inside the slots and be able to change their color and be able to see how much money the person betts in(slots, money bet, )
* Set click events to buttons which will start the slots and place a bet 
* Create start function  so the slots will generate a random number between 1-4, 
    the elements represented in the slots, and how much money the user has betted 
* Function also has to be able to match the three numbers in a row and maybe diagonal, 
    also be  able to declare how much the person won or lost 
    and render the message on top saying "YOUUUU WONNNN/LOSTTTT 50000"
* If player gets a losing combo or anything else besides a winning combo take away 
    the amount they bet   from total
    *When player's total amount is below 5
    *Make a sound function for the slots and disable the buttons
* Make reset button that will rest the money and clear the slots machine and the amount they had  back to 100 and undisable the buttons
